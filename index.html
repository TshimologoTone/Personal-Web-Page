    <h3>Location : Johannesburg</h3>
    I have a lot to say about this city which I call the land of possibilities. This is where me and my family moved in 2013, where I began my high school at one of the most prettiest places; the place has shaped a lot about who I am and where I want to go. I have met beautiful people, I have visited the most exciting places, and moreover this is where I had the ability to attend Uj, which was a great turn-over for my life and continually the varsity has supplied my needs and all that is required for growth with regards to my Psychological character and career orientation.

            During my undergraduate days I fell in love with a damsel and she was from the land of Mpumalanga in Bushbuckridge. So during our love, one day I was inspired to visit her at her home province and that was a whole beautiful experience, no lie the land is preetty hot and a bit dry but things are affordable and one can get a lot done through the day.
